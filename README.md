# s21_math  

s21_math is a custom implementation of the **math.h** library in C. This project aims to replicate fundamental mathematical functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and power functions while adhering to the **C11 standard** and **POSIX.1-2017**.  

## Key Features  
- Implementation of core **math.h** functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`, `pow`).  
- Developed in **C** with structured programming principles.  
- Packaged as a **static library (s21_math.a)** with a corresponding **header file (s21_math.h)**.  
- Full **unit test coverage** using the **Check library**, ensuring accuracy up to **16 significant digits**.  
- **Gcov report generation** for test coverage analysis.  
- **Makefile** with targets for compilation, testing, and coverage reports.  

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding computational methods and mathematical function implementations in C. ðŸš€
